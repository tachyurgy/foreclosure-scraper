Summary

I am currently looking for a developer to implement a periodic data extraction system from several websites, specifically Zillow, Dealio, and county websites in the United States.
Please find below the details of the project:

Project Objective:
•        Periodic data extraction from the following websites:
o        Zillow: Property details, including price, address, Zestimate, etc.
o        Dealio: Data about deals, discounts, and product descriptions.
o        County Websites: Property tax information, legal documents, tax map numbers, and ownership details.

Requirements:
•        Automation of data extraction, scheduled to run periodically (daily, weekly, or monthly).
•        Storage of the extracted data in an accessible format (e.g., CSV or database).
•        Data cleaning and organization for easier use and future analysis.

Zillow:
We will initially focus on York County, South Carolina, targeting the following  ZIP codes: 29732, 29745, 29730, 29710, 29708, 29704, 29726, 29717, 29715, 29702, 29743, 29712.

We require data from these county websites, exclusively:
Once every two weeks  
Dealio: The primary attributes required are: Pricing, Offer/Deal Description, Associated Contact Information (Phone Numbers, Email Addresses), and the direct Product URL
Once every two weeks  
County Websites: Our initial focus is York County, South Carolina. The target source is their public index/court roster system (e.g., as seen here: https://publicindex.sccourts.org/york/courtrosters/).
The required fields are specific to pending foreclosure cases and must include: Case Number, Plaintiff Attorney Name, Plaintiff Attorney Phone, Defendant Attorney Name, Defendant Attorney Phone, Defendant First/Last Name, and the associated Property Address (Street, City, State, Zip Code).  

Critical Project Workflow Dependency
The extractions are sequential. Data retrieved from the County Website (Step A) serves as the input query for the Zillow and Dealio lookups (Steps B & C).

-Step A (County Data Collection): Directly scrape the York County Public Index to extract specific foreclosure case details, including the associated Property Address.

-Step B (Zillow Lookup): Use the Property Address (from Step A) as the input query to retrieve market data from Zillow for that specific property.

-Step C (Dealio Lookup): Use the Property Address (from Step A) as the input query to search Dealio for any associated offers or deals.
We look forward to receiving your proposal, and timeline.
